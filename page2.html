        Something people forget is recovery. If you never rest, your body will feel heavy
        and you can get injured easier. I learned that training is not only working out,
        it is also taking care of your body after.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also think it helps to track your workouts. Even writing down small notes like
        “made 200 shots” or “felt tired today” can show patterns over time. When I keep
        it simple, it is easier to stay consistent.

        <h3>Things I try to do for recovery</h3>
        <p>
          I try to stretch after practice, sleep enough, and not ignore pain. If something
          hurts in a bad way, it’s smarter to rest than to make it worse.
