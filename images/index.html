        I picked this topic because basketball is a big part of my life, and training
        habits can change your level a lot. Many players train hard, but they don’t
        always train in a smart way.

      <p>
        In my opinion, good training is about consistency, recovery, and doing the basics
        every day. If you only train when you feel motivated, you will be up and down.
        I try to follow simple routines so I can improve even during busy weeks.

        <h3>Habits that help me stay consistent</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Warm up before every workout (mobility + light movement)</li>
          <li>Train ball-handling for a few minutes daily</li>
          <li>Take sleep seriously (it’s part of training)</li>
          <li>Drink water and eat enough protein</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My simple workout order</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Dynamic warm-up and stretching</li>
          <li>Form shooting close to the rim</li>
          <li>Game-speed shots (spot-up + off the dribble)</li>
          <li>Conditioning or sprints at the end</li>
        </ol>
